## What's Next

1. Make sure that the AI **truly understands** your complex task. A strategy from Dale Carnegie: don't ask if someone understood you or not; rather, ask them to retell it in their own words. Then, approve or correct according to Ai's retell of your task. Only after this validation, pass the idea to the model for code generation. Separate code generation and understanding the problem.
2. Extend support to other programming languages.
3. Extend support to programming frameworks.
4. Automate writing of test cases.
